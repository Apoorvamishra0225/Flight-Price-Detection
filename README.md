# Flight Price Detection


A Flight Price Prediction web application built using Flask and CatBoost Regressor that predicts the flight ticket price based on multiple inputs such as airline, source, destination, date and time of travel, and total stops. This project demonstrates the integration of a machine learning model into a web interface for real-time predictions.
